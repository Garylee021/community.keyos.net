  # Contributing to KeyOS

  KeyOS development process is open and transparent. We welcome everyone to contribute!
  There's a lot of work to do: writing code, writing and editing documentation,
  testing latest builds and more.

  ## Why contribute?

  ### Copyright stays with you

  Unlike some other projects, we intentionally do not use a contributor agreement
  that would give us exclusive rights to your contributions.

  The copyrights to KeyOS source code and documentation remain shared between all
  contributors, so that no one (including its current maintainers) can make a
  proprietary fork.

  ### We have rewards

  Maintaining an LTS version is a hard, delicate, high-responsibility work. Being
  a maintainer means not being able to refuse to work on the hard tasks. We keep
  prebuilt LTS images behind a paywall for that reason, but we are ready to share
  our work with everyone who helps us move the project forward.

  This includes everyone who contributes code, tests latest builds, writes
  documentation, or promotes KeyOS in the social media or at live events.

  Read about our [contributor subscriptions](/get/contributor-subscriptions) to
  review eligibility guidelines and
  [fill the application form](/get/contributor-subscriptions#application-form).

  We also have [badges](https://www.youracclaim.com/organizations/keyos/badges)!
